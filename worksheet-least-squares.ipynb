    "In many applied scenarios, it is not practical (or even, perhaps, possible)\n",
    "to find an exact solution to a problem.\n",
    "Sometimes we may be working with imperfect data.\n",
    "Other times, we may be dealing with a problem that is **overdetermined**,\n",
    "such as a system of linear equations with more equations than variables.\n",
    "(Quite often, both of these issues may be present.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(The term \"overdetermined\" is common in statistics. In other areas, such as physics, the term \"over-constrained\" is used instead.)\n",
    "\n",
    "An overdetermined system is quite likely to be inconsistent.\n",
    "That is, our problem requires finding a solution to a system $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$,\n",
    "where no such solution exists!\n",
    "When no solution is possible, we can ask whether it is instead possible to find a *best approximation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would a best approximation look like in this case?\n",
    "Let $U=\\operatorname{col}(A)$ denote the column space of $A$,\n",
    "which we know is a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (assuming $A$ is an $m\\times n$ matrix).\n",
    "The subspace $U$ is precisely the set of all vectors $\\mathbf{y}$ such that $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{y}$ has a solution.\n",
    "Among these vectors, we would like to find the one that is *closest* to $\\mathbf{b}$,\n",
    "in the sense that $\\lVert\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{b}\\rVert$ is as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we know exactly what this vector $\\mathbf{y}$ should be:\n",
    "the orthogonal projection of $\\mathbf{b}$ onto $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation in this worksheet is based on the one given in the text by Nicholson (see Section 5.6).\n",
    "Further details may be found there, or, for the more statistically inclined,\n",
    "on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares\")."
