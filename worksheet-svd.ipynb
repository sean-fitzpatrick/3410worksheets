    "If we start with a square matrix $A$, the results are the same, but if $A$ is not square, the decomposition $A = P\\Sigma_A Q^T$ looks a little different. In particular, if $A$ is $m\\times n$, the matrix $\\Sigma_A$ defined in [Section 4.5](https://opentext.uleth.ca/Math3410/section-matrix-factor.html) will also be $m\\times n\\text{,}$ but it will contain some rows or columns of zeros that are added to get the desired size. \n",
